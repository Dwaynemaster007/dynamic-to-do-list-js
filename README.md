# Dynamic To-Do List Application

## Project Overview

This is a single-page To-Do List application built entirely with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It is designed to demonstrate proficiency in creating interactive web applications by focusing on dynamic element creation and data persistence.

## Features

* **Add Tasks:** Users can enter a task and click the "Add Task" button or press the "Enter" key to add it to the list.
* **Remove Tasks:** Each task includes a "Remove" button for deletion.
* **DOM Manipulation:** Tasks are created and removed dynamically using JavaScript.
* **Data Persistence (Missing from requirements but necessary for "Advanced" status):** *Note: While the instructions heavily emphasize localStorage, the step-by-step guide does not include the saving/loading logic. This implementation focuses on the core DOM manipulation first, as explicitly requested.*

## Learning Objectives

This project meets the following objectives:

* **Advanced DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically creating `<li>` elements and nested `<button>` elements.
* **Event Handling:** Implementing `click` and `keypress` listeners.
* **Creating Dynamic Web Applications:** Building a fully functional application interface.
